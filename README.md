======
Uploading and Streaming may fail on any system that does not have MySQL
configured to deal with the large transfers. The following link explains
how to resolve it:
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/packet-too-large.html

Uploading shouldn't work on Windows systems as /tmp is used as the temp
upload location.
