Welcome to Macgril, thanks for downloading!
Macgril is a web framework for general 
purpose web application development. 
Its base is formed from the core of the 
eXastum Desktop. While developing and 
updating eXastum over the years it was 
clear it had become an unmaintainable 
mess and needed to be rebuilt. As part 
of the process, cleaning up the JS libs 
was essential and had to be done to make 
moving forward possible. Most of the code 
was silly, inefficent and practically 
unreadable. I also found myself reusing 
many eXastum functions in other projects 
and vice versa. It was clear that the most 
sensible thing to do would be to break out 
all of this code into a library that could 
form the foundations of all future projects 
and perhaps even be of use to others for their 
projects. This became macgril.js. Over time it 
became clear that just breaking out the JS was 
not enough, there were many common layouts that 
I would use over and over and many projects 
needed theming support. Building new HTML 
templates was a logical step and the eXastum 
themes found in different versions over the 
years formed the bases of Macgril's built in 
skins. The combination of all these things along 
with required documentation and examples forms 
what has today become the Macgril Framework. I 
hope you find it useful somehow and enjoy 
working with it. Happy Hacking.
