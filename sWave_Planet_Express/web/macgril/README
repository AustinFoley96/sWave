About Macgril
=====================
Welcome to Macgril, a general purpose web framework.
While developing the eXastum project I realised a lot of the 
functionality I was building could be useful for other web projects and 
did not need to be tied down and locked into the eXastum desktop. For 
this reason I decided to take most of that functionality and break it 
out into its own framework, that is what the Macgril Framework now is. 
My goal with the Macgril project is not just to make my own web projects 
easier but also to allow my work on eXastum and the discoveries I made 
during its development to benefit others regardless of whether or not 
the eXastum project itself is useful to them as now almost any feature 
found in eXastum can be quickly recreated in your own projects or websites 
simply by pulling in the Macgril Web Framework. Happy Hacking!
